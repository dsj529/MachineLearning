# MachineLearning
Various projects and scripts to explore machine learning and data analysis in Python

* ArticleSummarizer: NLP-based analyzer to create an article summary of N sentences based on word frequencies.  Optimized for WashingtonPost article formats.

* TestSpam: Framework to explore Machine Learning-based spam detection.  Uses data in the `emails.csv` file.  Implements Naive-Bayes, SGD, and Random Forest classifiers against the dataset.

* ArticleClassifier:  Collects a corpus of tech and non-tech articles from the NYTimes and Washington Post websites and creates a Naive-Bayes classifier to determine Tech/Non-Tech labels of test text.  Also presents K-Means clustering and TF-IDF vectorizing of text.

* Titanic2:  Uses the Kaggle Titanic Survivors dataset and compares the accuracy of Decision Tree, Random Forest, SGD and Gaussian Naive Bayes classification algorithms.
